# Phoneless xmas
By Jad Rabbaa and Yiyi Shao (26 October 2017)

This is the project created for experiment 2 for thr Creation and computation Course at OCAD University.

The idea is an installation of a christmas tree made from phones loading a p5.js project to help christmas experience become more social and engaged and people less involved in their phones in socil events.

Phone are hung on a structure.

There are 2 sections for this project, the first is for the christmas ball, and the second for the star:
phonelessxmas1 = Christmas Ball
star = christmas Star

1-phonelessxmas1 = Christmas Ball:
Visual: A christmas ball that is randomly colored on load.
        It swings with the swinging of the phone.
        It changes in size relatively to the Rotation of the phone.
        On tap, an animation of confetti appears on touch.
        
Audio: prelaoding a set of audios saying merry christmas in a different language each.
       on Tap, the audio plays.
       on RotationX (phone swinging from the structure or tree), the pitch of the audio changes from high to low relatively to the angle of rotation.
       
                 
2-Star = the top star.
Visual: several rotating starts.
Audio: on tap, playing a long "we wish you a merry chrismtas" music.
